description: "A Crystal Age is a utopian novel/ Dystopia written by W. H. Hudson,\
  \ first published in 1887. The book has been called a \"significant S-F milestone\"\
  \ and has been noted for its anticipation of the \"modern ecological mysticism\"\
  \ that would evolve a century later.\nThe book was first issued anonymously in 1887.\
  \ The second edition of 1906 identified the author by name, and included a preface\
  \ by Hudson. The third edition of 1916 added a foreword by Clifford Smith.\n From\
  \ Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
